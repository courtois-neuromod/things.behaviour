THINGS behavioural & eye-tracking data analyses
===============================================

## Image Recognition Performance Metrics

Metrics of behavioural performance on the continuous image recognition task (hits, false alarm, d', reaction times) are computed per run, per session (6 runs except for session 1) and per subject (across all sessions) from run-specific ``*events.tsv`` files.

Scores are outputed as ``.tsv`` files in the ``THINGS/behaviour`` dataset. Output columns are described in ``task-things_beh.json``

Launch the following script to process all subjects & sessions
```bash
DATADIR="cneuromod-things/THINGS/fmriprep/sourcedata/things"
OUTDIR="cneuromod-things/THINGS/behaviour"

python code/behav_data_memoperformance.py --idir="${DATADIR}" --odir="${OUTDIR}" --clean
```

Of note, a handful of sessions had their planned patterns of repetition affected by a session administered out of order (sub-03's sessions 24, 25 and 26; sub-06's sessions 19 to 26). These sessions included "atypical trials" (e.g., images shown more than 3 times), and were excluded from the computation of behavioural performance metrics (they were flagged with ``exclude_session == True`` in their ``*events.tsv`` file).

*Input*:

- All four subjects' ``*events.tsv`` files, across sessions (~36) and runs (6 per session), e.g., ``sub-03_ses-17_task-thingsmemory_run-02_events.tsv``


*Output*:

- ``na_report.txt``, a text file that lists every run for which at least one behavioural response is missing (no button press recorded for at least one trial)
- ``sub-0*/beh/sub-0*_task-things_desc-perTrial_beh.tsv``, a concatenation of all events.tsv trials (excludes all trials with no button press). Columns and their values correspond to those of events.tsv files, as described in ``cneuromod-things/THINGS/fmriprep/sourcedata/things/task-things_events.json``
- ``sub-0*/beh/sub-0*_task-things_desc-perRun_beh.tsv``, performance metrics per run (excludes runs from session 1). Columns are described in ``task-things_beh.json``
- ``sub-0*/beh/sub-0*_task-things_desc-perSession_beh.tsv``, performance metrics per session (includes session 1). Columns are described in ``task-things_beh.json``
- ``sub-0*/beh/sub-0*_task-things_desc-global_beh.tsv``, subject's overall performance metrics on the entire task (excludes session 1 in the averaging). Columns are described in ``task-things_beh.json``


---------------------------
## Trial-Wise Image Ratings and Annotations

Image ratings from the [THINGS](https://things-initiative.org/) and THINGSplus datasets, and manual image annotations produced specifically for CNeuroMod-things, are assigned to each trial to perform representation analyses. Annotated trials are outputted as ``.tsv`` files per subject in the ``THINGS/behaviour`` dataset.

The following image annotation files were downloaded from the [THINGS object concept and object image database](https://osf.io/jum2f/), and saved directly under ``cneuromod-things/THINGS/fmriprep/sourcedata/things/stimuli/annotations/THINGS+``:
* ``THINGS/things_concepts.tsv``
* ``THINGSplus/Metadata/Concept-specific/arousal_meanRatings.tsv``
* ``THINGSplus/Metadata/Concept-specific/category53_wideFormat.tsv``
* ``THINGSplus/Metadata/Concept-specific/objectProperties_meanRatings.tsv``
* ``THINGSplus/Metadata/Concept-specific/size_meanRatings.tsv``
* ``THINGSplus/Metadata/Image-specific/imageLabeling_imageWise.tsv``
* ``THINGSplus/Metadata/Image-specific/imageLabeling_objectWise.tsv``

See the [THINGSplus preprint](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/exu9f) for more information about these annotations.

Launch the following script to process a subject's sessions
```bash
EVDIR="cneuromod-things/THINGS/fmriprep/sourcedata/things"
ANDIR="cneuromod-things/THINGS/fmriprep/sourcedata/things/stimuli/annotations"
OUTDIR="cneuromod-things/THINGS/behaviour"

python code/behav_data_annotate.py --events_dir="${EVDIR}" --annot_dir="${ANDIR}" --out_dir="${OUTDIR}" --sub="01"
```

*Input*:

- A subject's ``*events.tsv`` files, across sessions (~36) and runs (6 per session), e.g., ``sub-03_ses-17_task-thingsmemory_run-02_events.tsv``
- Various annotation files saved under ``stimuli/annotations``. E.g., ``task-things_desc-manual_annotation.tsv``

*Output*:

- ``sub-0*/beh/sub-0*_task-things_desc-perTrial_annotation.tsv``, trialwise annotations for a concatenation of all events.tsv files. Columns are described in ``task-things_desc-perTrial_annotation.json``
- ``sub-0*/beh/sub-0*_task-things_catNum.tsv``, list of categories of images shown to the subject throughout the experiment
- ``sub-0*/beh/sub-0*_task-things_imgNum.tsv``, list of image numbers for images shown to the subject throughout the experiment

## Fixation Compliance Metrics

The script ``code/analyze_fixations.py`` processes eye-tracking data and its derivatives. It concatenates trial-wise fixation compliance metrics across all runs. It also converts drift-corrected gaze from normalized scores (as proportions of the projector screen) into degrees of visual angles (relative distance in x and y from central fixation mark, and absolute distance from central fixation) for trials with recorded button presses (gaze points are filtered above a set threshold of pupil detection confidence and then downsampled to 1 every 5 points, corresponding to a maximum of 50 Hz).

```bash
DATADIR="path/to/cneuromod-things"

python code/analyze_fixations.py --sub_num="01" --data_dir="${DATADIR}"
```

**Input**:
- A subject's ``sub-*_ses-*_task-things_run-*_events.tsv`` files, across sessions (~36) and runs (6 per session)
- ``sub-0*_ses-*_task-things_run-*_eyetrack.tsv.gz``, files of drift-corrected gaze per run

**Output**:
- ``sub-0*_task-things_desc-driftCor_gaze.tsv``, drift-corrected gaze (in degrees of visual angle from the central fixation mark) sampled during the image-viewing portion of each trials, concatenated across all runs. Includes 1 out of 5 gaze points derived from pupils detected above a set confidence threshold, from trials for which an answer (button press) was recorded.
- ``sub-0*_task-things_desc-fixCompliance_statseries.tsv``, trial-wise metrics of fixation compliance concatenated across all events.tsv files (all runs). Columns are described in ``task-things_desc-fixCompliance_statseries.json``
