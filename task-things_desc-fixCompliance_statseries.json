    "fix_gaze_count_ratio": "The ratio [0, 1] of gaze points captured during the fixation period (used to realign the trial's gaze; defined by the drift correction strategy). The ratio is calculated based on the fixation duration and the eyetrackin camera sampling rate. Low numbers may indicate eyetracking camera freezes.",

    "fix_dist2med_ratio_0.5": "The ratio [0, 1] of gaze points within 0.5 degrees of visual angle from the median gaze position during the trial's fixation period. Low ratios indicate high variability in gaze position during fixation, which hinders the trial's drift correction (poor estimation of the point of central fixation.)",
