The featured object is shown centrally with no additional objects visible in the periphery or background. Not only is the object shown by itself, but the empty background is uniform and minimally textured (no carpet, dinner mat or wooden fence behind) or blurred so that only the lone object is in focus. Note that objects can either be shown with zero background (the “lone objects” flag), with minimal background (e.g., an apple in a basket on a table), with noticeable background (the “rich background” flag) or within a scene (with background and perspective).",
    "manual_human_face": "human_face boolean from manual annotation (task-things_desc-manual_annotations.tsv). Contains any face or portion of a face with human features, central or in the periphery, real or artificial (a doll’s face, a cartoon of a person’s face, etc).",

Includes: faces of rodents, dogs, felines, cows, deers, etc. Excludes: faces of insects, reptiles, fish, birds, sea mammals (e.g., dolphins and whales).

E.g., An image featuring a person jumping on a pogo stick is considered central if the face is visible, while faces of random spectators in the background are not. Although the face does not need to be in the middle of the image to be “central” per se, the face should be visible when gazing at a central fixation cross, and it must be part of the image’s main focus of interest.",
    "manual_central_body": "central_body boolean from manual annotation (task-things_desc-manual_annotations.tsv). Contains a body or non-face body part within the image’s central focus. E.g., an image featuring a hand holding an item of interest is central, while a silhouette visible next to an aircraft carrier seen from afar is not. Although the body (part) does not need to be in the center of the image to be “central”, it should be visible when gazing at a central fixation cross, and it must be part of the image’s main focus of interest.",
    "manual_artificial_face": "artificial_face boolean from manual annotation (task-things_desc-manual_annotations.tsv). Contains any representation of a human, animal or humanoid face that is not a real (living) face.

    "manual_artificial_body": "artificial_body boolean from manual annotation (task-things_desc-manual_annotations.tsv). Contains any representation of a human, animal or humanoid body or non-face body part that is not a real (living) body (part). Eg., a statue, a prosthetic leg, a robotic hand, a drawing of a bird on a teapot.",
    "manual_scene": "scene boolean from manual annotation (task-things_desc-manual_annotations.tsv). An item pictured in an environment with a background and a foreground that gives the sense of a place around it. A scene includes scenery, a view point and some perspective. It can be the image of a large object in a specific setting, like an aircraft in a hangard, a sofa in the middle of a living room, an anchor by a waterfront, an elephant at the zoo or a person skateboarding in a busy park.",
    "manual_rich_background": "rich_background boolean from manual annotation (task-things_desc-manual_annotations.tsv). An image of an object taken from closer than a scene, but that still includes items, people or animals clearly visible in the background. E.g., a backpack on someone’s back walking away toward some trees, a tool in a garage with equipment visible behind it, a plant in a garden surrounded by other plants, a beer glass held by a person sitting between others, an apple on a table with orchard trees behind it."
